## **WHAT IS REACT?**

React is an open-source JavaScript library used for user interface development. Despite being created back in 2013 by the giant Facebook, it continues to be widely used.
Two of the numerous features of this library include the use of the Virtual DOM, which allows for fast element rendering, and components, which allow for organized code structure.

Some of the most famous websites built with React include:

<li> Facebook </li>
<li> AirBnb </li>
